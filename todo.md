**Enhancing P2P Functionality:**

To further enhance your P2P functionality and make it more robust, you can consider the following:

- [x] 1. **Dynamic Port Assignment**: Instead of hardcoding port numbers, you can use dynamic port assignment to ensure that multiple peers on the same machine can run simultaneously without port conflicts.

- [ ] 2. **Discovery Mechanism**: Implement a mechanism for peers to discover each other on the network. This can involve a central server acting as a tracker or a decentralized method like broadcasting discovery messages.

- [ ] 3. **Handshake Protocol**: Implement a handshake protocol for establishing connections. During the handshake, peers can exchange information such as their identity, capabilities, and supported message formats.

- [ ] 4. **Peer Discovery**: Create a method for peers to discover and connect to other peers on the network. This can involve maintaining a list of known peers and periodically checking for their availability.

- [ ] 5. **Message Serialization**: Implement a message serialization format (e.g., JSON) to structure your messages. This makes it easier for peers to understand and process incoming data.

- [ ] 6. **Error Handling**: Add error handling and graceful termination to your code to handle various network-related issues, such as dropped connections or timeouts.

- [ ] 7. **Security**: Consider security aspects, such as encryption and authentication, to protect the integrity and confidentiality of your communications.

- [ ] 8. **Scalability**: Think about how your P2P network can handle a growing number of peers efficiently. Techniques like Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) can help with scalability.

- [ ] 9. **Reliability**: Implement mechanisms for message acknowledgment and retransmission to ensure reliable message delivery.

- [ ] 10. **NAT Traversal**: Handle Network Address Translation (NAT) traversal to allow peers behind routers to communicate with peers outside their local network.

- [ ] 11. **Peer Disconnect Handling**: Implement logic for handling peer disconnects gracefully, updating the list of available peers, and cleaning up resources.

- [ ] 12. **Documentation**: Document your code and protocols thoroughly, making it easier for others to understand and contribute to your P2P project.
